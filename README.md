# Maze Bot with A* Search Algorithm - Python
Welcome to the Maze Bot project! This program utilizes the A* search algorithm to solve mazes efficiently, accompanied by a graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive maze solving.

# Overview
The Maze Bot is designed to navigate through mazes using the A* search algorithm, a heuristic search algorithm that finds the shortest path from a start point to a goal point. The program provides a user-friendly GUI interface for visualizing the maze solving process in real-time.

# Features
A* Search Algorithm: The program employs the A* search algorithm to intelligently navigate through mazes by considering both the cost of reaching a particular point and the estimated distance to the goal.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The GUI allows users to visualize the maze, mark the start and goal points, and observe the maze solving process step by step.
